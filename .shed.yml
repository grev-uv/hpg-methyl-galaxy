long_description: |
  HPG-Methyl is an ultrafast and highly sensitive Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) read mapper and methylation context extractor. 
  Compared with other current mapping and methylation extraction tools, HPG-Methyl offers better sensitivity and shorter execution 
  times even for long reads.

  Since the files generated by HPG-Methyl are fully compatible with the files generated by other popular tools, it can be used as 
  a drop-in replacement to accelerate existing methylation analysis pipelines.
